# Slacking Off Editor

**Read books while pretending to work.**

---

## About The Project

Have you ever wanted to catch up on your reading list at work, but felt the prying eyes of your colleagues or boss? The Slacking Off Editor is your solution. It looks and feels like a simple, distraction-free text editor, allowing you to type, edit, and write as you normally would. 

However, with a secret hotkey, you can instantly transform a line of your editor into a hidden e-reader, displaying content from your favorite `.epub` or `.txt` files. This allows you to discreetly read a few pages and then quickly switch back to your "work" when someone walks by.

## Features

*   **Discreet Reading:** Read your books inside a fully functional text editor.
*   **Automatic Progress Saving:** Your reading position for the last 5 books is automatically saved. Pick up right where you left off!
*   **Boss Key:** Instantly toggle between writing and reading mode with a secret hotkey (`Ctrl+Shift+S`).
*   **Supports Your Books:** Load any `.epub` or `.txt` file.
*   **Customizable:** Choose which line to display the book content on and how many characters to show at a time.
*   **Realistic UI:** A clean, paper-like interface with dynamic line numbers that looks like a real writing tool.
*   **Word & Character Count:** Real-time feedback on your writing.
*   **Export:** Save your written text to a `.txt` file.
